PostOutLoud!!


PROPOSAL

A. The problem/Task
	While Facebook and Twitter and other social media sites allow for people to share their experiences and spread the word about certain causes, those tasks remain difficult to do because so many people on these social networks do not immediately associate the platform as a vehicle for social justice (for many people, Facebook and Twitter remain networks that are for themselves, family, and friends). At this point, there is no online community that is specifically dedicated to fighting everyday social injustices and designed for social movement communities.

B. Solution
	This web-based forum/message board would be specifically designed to facilitate and promote discussions about racism,  homophobia, transphobia, sexism, and other social prejudices. Such a forum would allow for passionate advocates of similar causes about equality to come together and share relevant photos, videos, and text posts (i.e. examples of a social injustice, experiences). Includes a feature for others to comment and respond to posts.

C. Implementation
	HTML/CSS To create the UI.
	JavaScript for back-end development.
	Database to hold posts

D. Monetization
	Ads built into the website can help pay to keep the website hosted.

RISK ASSESSMENT
1. If we cannot get database of all posts to work and not just clear with the browser closing, we will just use a set of dummy posts.

2. If we cannot link each password to its respective post and make them retrievable, we will either a) not have an option for editing posts or b) allow anyone to edit a post.

3. If we do not have enough time to make the UI pretty, we will have to deal with an ugly UI.
